New Yorkers Brave Strong Winds and Rain During Powerful Nor'easter
NEW YORK - A powerful nor'easter slammed New York City yesterday, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and localized flooding across the region. The storm knocked out power to over 50,000 Con Edison customers in the city's outer boroughs and caused significant disruptions to public transportation.
Subway lines were delayed during the morning commute as crews worked to pump water out of flooded stations. Numerous streets in lower Manhattan were closed due to flooding. The PATH train also experienced delays and suspensions as crews inspected tracks and signal problems.
Above ground, scaffolding collapsed in some areas and roof damage was reported. Central Park saw over 3 inches of rain, and wind gusts reached up to 60 mph along the coast.
"It was incredibly windy, I could hardly hold my umbrella upright," said Lisa Chen, a resident of Queens. "I waited over 40 minutes for a delayed subway, it was packed with soaked, grumpy commuters."
While cleanup from the powerful nor'easter continues today, the storm has moved offshore and skies are clearing. The weather forecast shows drier conditions over the next few days as New Yorkers recover from the effects of the storm.

Famed Carnegie Deli Announces Sudden Closure
NEW YORK - In an unexpected announcement that shocked many New Yorkers, the iconic Carnegie Deli said it is closing its doors after nearly 80 years in business. The legendary deli, known for its huge pastrami and corned beef sandwiches, has been struggling financially for years but tried to stay open out of loyalty to its longtime customers.
"We are very sad to announce that after 79 years, the Carnegie Deli will be closing at the end of this year," said owner Marian Harper Levine in a statement. "This hasn't been an easy decision, but due to rising rents and operating costs, we simply can no longer sustain our business."
Hundreds of nostalgic New Yorkers lined up outside the deli after news spread of its imminent closure. Many thanked the staff for their dedication over the decades and shared fond memories of family meals and celebrations held at Carnegie's Formica tables.
The deli first opened in 1937 and quickly became a staple for Broadway performers, sports figures, and local office workers. It developed an international reputation and was often mentioned in films and TV shows set in New York.
Many see Carnegie's closure as symbolic of a fading era in New York City. "It's the end of an institution," said Robert Jones, a long-time patron. "You can't find character like the Carnegie Deli anymore."

NYC Subway Riders Stuck Underground After Power Outage
NEW YORK - Thousands of New York City subway riders were stranded underground for over an hour after a major power outage brought multiple train lines to a halt during rush hour last evening. According to the MTA, a dip in voltage from the city's power grid caused dozens of subway cars to stall in tunnels and stations across Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Frustrated riders reported being stuck on non-moving trains for up to 90 minutes without air conditioning or updates from transit officials. Some attempted to pry open car doors and walk through dark tunnels back to the platform. "We were packed in like sardines, it was sweltering hot, and nobody knew what was going on," said Lauren Murphy, a rider stuck on a train near the Avenue H station.
After power was restored, residual delays plagued the system long into the night as crews worked to get all passengers off trains and platforms cleared. The outage impacted over 30 subway lines during what is typically the busiest time of day on the transit system.
The MTA has launched an investigation into the cause of the voltage dip that cascaded into a system-wide failure. "We apologize to all the riders who were severely delayed by this power outage and we will be working diligently to determine exactly what happened," said MTA Chairman Patrick Foye. This incident has renewed calls for upgrading the aging subway system to avoid future widespread failures.
